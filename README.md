# OrderApp
Assignment Native Apps Android
This app is a POC of an idea I might want to build on in the future

## The idea
About a year ago, me and a friend were having dinner. The place we were eating at happened to have an iPad at the counter where you could order food and drinks. At the time we fantasised about how nice it would be if the app runnin on the iPad ran on our phones. That way we would both have easy access to the menu and we could both take our own time to order (and even pay separately)
Fastforward to the recent pandemic, and businesses have taken to sticking QR codes on the tables that directs customers to a site that hosts their menu. Upon noticing this I thought It would be great if that link also allowed you to order and pay since you could embedd the table information in the QR code / link.

## The POC Android app
I wanted to try implementing the basics that would also show what I've learned during the android courses:
- scanning a QR code to grab the restaurant and table information
- an option to enter the code manually
- selecting the items you want to order
- a way to see your order history
